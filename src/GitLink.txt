# NOTE: I had some issues downloading Git on the VM, so for the first few commits (beginning at ~40% completion) I committed manually. 
# Once Git was working, I created a new repository to sync directly. Both repositories are included below.
# No changes were made between the end of the first repo and the start of the second. Apologies for the mess.
